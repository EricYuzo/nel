# nel

This is a very, very simple vim color file.

Note: It sets only _cterm_ colors. So, it does not work on gvim.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository;
2. Copy `colors/nel.vim` into `~/.vim/colors/nel.vim`;
3. Add these two lines to your `~/.vimrc` file:
   ```
   syntax on
   colorscheme nel
   ```
